This is a tiny script that i have developed quite a while ago to automate fetching a new podcast from www.spektrum.de and send it to my telegram channel,
If run on server can handle cron jobs as well.
You need a telegram bot added to both your channel and group as admin and your channel id,
The bot is live running in My telegram channel : <a href='https://t.me/+y7-l2vGlTFQ2Njg0'>Here <img src="https://telegram.org/img/favicon-16x16.png" alt="Open In Telgram" data-canonical-src="https://telegram.org/img/favicon-16x16.png" style="max-width: 1%;"></a><br>
Feel free to fork it!
